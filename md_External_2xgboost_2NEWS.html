v1.7.0 (2022 Oct 20)</h1>
<p>We are excited to announce the feature packed XGBoost 1.7 release. The release note will walk through some of the major new features first, then make a summary for other improvements and language-binding-specific changes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md216"></a>
PySpark</h2>
<p>XGBoost 1.7 features initial support for PySpark integration. The new interface is adapted from the existing PySpark XGBoost interface developed by databricks with additional features like <code>QuantileDMatrix</code> and the rapidsai plugin (GPU pipeline) support. The new Spark XGBoost Python estimators not only benefit from PySpark ml facilities for powerful distributed computing but also enjoy the rest of the Python ecosystem. Users can define a custom objective, callbacks, and metrics in Python and use them with this interface on distributed clusters. The support is labeled as experimental with more features to come in future releases. For a brief introduction please visit the tutorial on XGBoost's <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/spark_estimator.html">document page</a>. (#8355, #8344, #8335, #8284, #8271, #8283, #8250, #8231, #8219, #8245, #8217, #8200, #8173, #8172, #8145, #8117, #8131, #8088, #8082, #8085, #8066, #8068, #8067, #8020, #8385)</p>
<p>Due to its initial support status, the new interface has some limitations; categorical features and multi-output models are not yet supported.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md217"></a>
Development of categorical data support</h2>
<p>More progress on the experimental support for categorical features. In 1.7, XGBoost can handle missing values in categorical features and features a new parameter <code>max_cat_threshold</code>, which limits the number of categories that can be used in the split evaluation. The parameter is enabled when the partitioning algorithm is used and helps prevent over-fitting. Also, the sklearn interface can now accept the <code>feature_types</code> parameter to use data types other than dataframe for categorical features. (#8280, #7821, #8285, #8080, #7948, #7858, #7853, #8212, #7957, #7937, #7934)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md218"></a>
Experimental support for federated learning and new communication collective</h2>
<p>An exciting addition to XGBoost is the experimental federated learning support. The federated learning is implemented with a gRPC federated server that aggregates allreduce calls, and federated clients that train on local data and use existing tree methods (approx, hist, gpu_hist). Currently, this only supports horizontal federated learning (samples are split across participants, and each participant has all the features and labels). Future plans include vertical federated learning (features split across participants), and stronger privacy guarantees with homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. See <a class="el" href="md_External_2xgboost_2demo_2nvflare_2README.html">Demo with NVFlare integration</a> for example usage with nvflare.</p>
<p>As part of the work, XGBoost 1.7 has replaced the old rabit module with the new collective module as the network communication interface with added support for runtime backend selection. In previous versions, the backend is defined at compile time and can not be changed once built. In this new release, users can choose between <code>rabit</code> and <code>federated.</code> (#8029, #8351, #8350, #8342, #8340, #8325, #8279, #8181, #8027, #7958, #7831, #7879, #8257, #8316, #8242, #8057, #8203, #8038, #7965, #7930, #7911)</p>
<p>The feature is available in the public PyPI binary package for testing.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md219"></a>
Quantile DMatrix</h2>
<p>Before 1.7, XGBoost has an internal data structure called <code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> (and its distributed version). We now extend its support to CPU and renamed it to <code>QuantileDMatrix</code>. This data structure is used for optimizing memory usage for the <code>hist</code> and <code>gpu_hist</code> tree methods. The new feature helps reduce CPU memory usage significantly, especially for dense data. The new <code>QuantileDMatrix</code> can be initialized from both CPU and GPU data, and regardless of where the data comes from, the constructed instance can be used by both the CPU algorithm and GPU algorithm including training and prediction (with some overhead of conversion if the device of data and training algorithm doesn't match). Also, a new parameter <code>ref</code> is added to <code>QuantileDMatrix</code>, which can be used to construct validation/test datasets. Lastly, it's set as default in the scikit-learn interface when a supported tree method is specified by users. (#7889, #7923, #8136, #8215, #8284, #8268, #8220, #8346, #8327, #8130, #8116, #8103, #8094, #8086, #7898, #8060, #8019, #8045, #7901, #7912, #7922)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md220"></a>
Mean absolute error</h2>
<p>The mean absolute error is a new member of the collection of objectives in XGBoost. It's noteworthy since MAE has zero hessian value, which is unusual to XGBoost as XGBoost relies on Newton optimization. Without valid Hessian values, the convergence speed can be slow. As part of the support for MAE, we added line searches into the XGBoost training algorithm to overcome the difficulty of training without valid Hessian values. In the future, we will extend the line search to other objectives where it's appropriate for faster convergence speed. (#8343, #8107, #7812, #8380)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md221"></a>
XGBoost on Browser</h2>
<p>With the help of the <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide">pyodide</a> project, you can now run XGBoost on browsers. (#7954, #8369)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md222"></a>
Experimental IPv6 Support for Dask</h2>
<p>With the growing adaption of the new internet protocol, XGBoost joined the club. In the latest release, the Dask interface can be used on IPv6 clusters, see XGBoost's Dask tutorial for details. (#8225, #8234)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md223"></a>
Optimizations</h2>
<p>We have new optimizations for both the <code>hist</code> and <code>gpu_hist</code> tree methods to make XGBoost's training even more efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hist Hist now supports optional by-column histogram build, which is automatically configured based on various conditions of input data. This helps the XGBoost CPU hist algorithm to scale better with different shapes of training datasets. (#8233, #8259). Also, the build histogram kernel now can better utilize CPU registers (#8218)</li>
<li>GPU Hist GPU hist performance is significantly improved for wide datasets. GPU hist now supports batched node build, which reduces kernel latency and increases throughput. The improvement is particularly significant when growing deep trees with the default <code>depthwise</code> policy. (#7919, #8073, #8051, #8118, #7867, #7964, #8026)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md224"></a>
Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>Breaking changes made in the 1.7 release are summarized below.</p><ul>
<li>The <code>grow_local_histmaker</code> updater is removed. This updater is rarely used in practice and has no test. We decided to remove it and focus have XGBoot focus on other more efficient algorithms. (#7992, #8091)</li>
<li>Single precision histogram is removed due to its lack of accuracy caused by significant floating point error. In some cases the error can be difficult to detect due to log-scale operations, which makes the parameter dangerous to use. (#7892, #7828)</li>
<li>Deprecated CUDA architectures are no longer supported in the release binaries. (#7774)</li>
<li>As part of the federated learning development, the <code>rabit</code> module is replaced with the new <code>collective</code> module. It's a drop-in replacement with added runtime backend selection, see the federated learning section for more details (#8257)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md225"></a>
General new features and improvements</h2>
<p>Before diving into package-specific changes, some general new features other than those listed at the beginning are summarized here.</p><ul>
<li>Users of <code>DMatrix</code> and <code>QuantileDMatrix</code> can get the data from XGBoost. In previous versions, only getters for meta info like labels are available. The new method is available in Python (<code>DMatrix::get_data</code>) and C. (#8269, #8323)</li>
<li>In previous versions, the GPU histogram tree method may generate phantom gradient for missing values due to floating point error. We fixed such an error in this release and XGBoost is much better equated to handle floating point errors when training on GPU. (#8274, #8246)</li>
<li>Parameter validation is no longer experimental. (#8206)</li>
<li>C pointer parameters and JSON parameters are vigorously checked. (#8254, #8254)</li>
<li>Improved handling of JSON model input. (#7953, #7918)</li>
<li>Support IBM i OS (#7920, #8178)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md226"></a>
Fixes</h2>
<p>Some noteworthy bug fixes that are not related to specific language binding are listed in this section.</p><ul>
<li>Rename misspelled config parameter for pseudo-Huber (#7904)</li>
<li>Fix feature weights with nested column sampling. (#8100)</li>
<li>Fix loading DMatrix binary in distributed env. (#8149)</li>
<li>Force auc.cc to be statically linked for unusual compiler platforms. (#8039)</li>
<li>New logic for detecting libomp on macos (#8384).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md227"></a>
Python Package</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.8 is now the minimum required Python version. (#8071)</li>
<li>More progress on type hint support. Except for the new PySpark interface, the XGBoost module is fully typed. (#7742, #7945, #8302, #7914, #8052)</li>
<li>XGBoost now validates the feature names in <code>inplace_predict</code>, which also affects the predict function in scikit-learn estimators as it uses <code>inplace_predict</code> internally. (#8359)</li>
<li>Users can now get the data from <code>DMatrix</code> using <code>DMatrix::get_data</code> or <code>QuantileDMatrix::get_data</code>.</li>
<li>Show <code>libxgboost.so</code> path in build info. (#7893)</li>
<li>Raise import error when using the sklearn module while scikit-learn is missing. (#8049)</li>
<li>Use <code>config_context</code> in the sklearn interface. (#8141)</li>
<li>Validate features for inplace prediction. (#8359)</li>
<li>Pandas dataframe handling is refactored to reduce data fragmentation. (#7843)</li>
<li>Support more pandas nullable types (#8262)</li>
<li>Remove pyarrow workaround. (#7884)</li>
<li>Binary wheel size We aim to enable as many features as possible in XGBoost's default binary distribution on PyPI (package installed with pip), but there's a upper limit on the size of the binary wheel. In 1.7, XGBoost reduces the size of the wheel by pruning unused CUDA architectures. (#8179, #8152, #8150)</li>
<li>Fixes Some noteworthy fixes are listed here:<ul>
<li>Fix the Dask interface with the latest cupy. (#8210)</li>
<li>Check cuDF lazily to avoid potential errors with cuda-python. (#8084)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix potential error in DMatrix constructor on 32-bit platform. (#8369)</li>
<li>Maintenance work<ul>
<li>Linter script is moved from dmlc-core to XGBoost with added support for formatting, mypy, and parallel run, along with some fixes (#7967, #8101, #8216)</li>
<li>We now require the use of <code>isort</code> and <code>black</code> for selected files. (#8137, #8096)</li>
<li>Code cleanups. (#7827)</li>
<li>Deprecate <code>use_label_encoder</code> in XGBClassifier. The label encoder has already been deprecated and removed in the previous version. These changes only affect the indicator parameter (#7822)</li>
<li>Remove the use of distutils. (#7770)</li>
<li>Refactor and fixes for tests (#8077, #8064, #8078, #8076, #8013, #8010, #8244, #7833)</li>
</ul>

<li>Clarification for feature importance. (#8151)</li>
<li>Simplify Python getting started example (#8153)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md228"></a>
R Package</h2>
<p>We summarize improvements for the R package briefly here:</p><ul>
<li>Feature info including names and types are now passed to DMatrix in preparation for categorical feature support. (#804)</li>
<li>XGBoost 1.7 can now gracefully load old R models from RDS for better compatibility with 3-party tuning libraries (#7864)</li>
<li>The R package now can be built with parallel compilation, along with fixes for warnings in CRAN tests. (#8330)</li>
<li>Emit error early if DiagrammeR is missing (#8037)</li>
<li>Fix R package Windows build. (#8065)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md229"></a>
JVM Packages</h2>
<p>The consistency between JVM packages and other language bindings is greatly improved in 1.7, improvements range from model serialization format to the default value of hyper-parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java package now supports feature names and feature types for DMatrix in preparation for categorical feature support. (#7966)</li>
<li>Models trained by the JVM packages can now be safely used with other language bindings. (#7896, #7907)</li>
<li>Users can specify the model format when saving models with a stream. (#7940, #7955)</li>
<li>The default value for training parameters is now sourced from XGBoost directly, which helps JVM packages be consistent with other packages. (#7938)</li>
<li>Set the correct objective if the user doesn't explicitly set it (#7781)</li>
<li>Auto-detection of MUSL is replaced by system properties (#7921)</li>
<li>Improved error message for launching tracker. (#7952, #7968)</li>
<li>Fix a race condition in parameter configuration. (#8025)</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md232"></a>
CI and Tests</h2>
<ul>
<li>We overhauled the CI infrastructure to reduce the CI cost and lift the maintenance burdens. Jenkins is replaced with buildkite for better automation, with which, finer control of test runs is implemented to reduce overall cost. Also, we refactored some of the existing tests to reduce their runtime, drooped the size of docker images, and removed multi-GPU C++ tests. Lastly, <code>pytest-timeout</code> is added as an optional dependency for running Python tests to keep the test time in check. (#7772, #8291, #8286, #8276, #8306, #8287, #8243, #8313, #8235, #8288, #8303, #8142, #8092, #8333, #8312, #8348)</li>

v1.6.0 (2022 Apr 16)</h1>
<p>After a long period of development, XGBoost v1.6.0 is packed with many new features and improvements. We summarize them in the following sections starting with an introduction to some major new features, then moving on to language binding specific changes including new features and notable bug fixes for that binding.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md237"></a>
Development of categorical data support</h2>
<p>This version of XGBoost features new improvements and full coverage of experimental categorical data support in Python and C package with tree model. Both <code>hist</code>, <code>approx</code> and <code>gpu_hist</code> now support training with categorical data. Also, partition-based categorical split is introduced in this release. This split type is first available in <a class="el" href="namespaceLightGBM.html" title="desc and descl2 fields must be written in reStructuredText format">LightGBM</a> in the context of gradient boosting. The previous XGBoost release supported one-hot split where the splitting criteria is of form <code>x \in {c}</code>, i.e. the categorical feature <code>x</code> is tested against a single candidate. The new release allows for more expressive conditions: <code>x \in S</code> where the categorical feature <code>x</code> is tested against multiple candidates. Moreover, it is now possible to use any tree algorithms (<code>hist</code>, <code>approx</code>, <code>gpu_hist</code>) when creating categorical splits. For more information, please see our tutorial on <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/categorical.html">categorical data</a>, along with examples linked on that page. (#7380, #7708, #7695, #7330, #7307, #7322, #7705, #7652, #7592, #7666, #7576, #7569, #7529, #7575, #7393, #7465, #7385, #7371, #7745, #7810)</p>
<p>In the future, we will continue to improve categorical data support with new features and optimizations. Also, we are looking forward to bringing the feature beyond Python binding, contributions and feedback are welcomed! Lastly, as a result of experimental status, the behavior might be subject to change, especially the default value of related hyper-parameters.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md238"></a>
Experimental support for multi-output model</h2>
<p>XGBoost 1.6 features initial support for the multi-output model, which includes multi-output regression and multi-label classification. Along with this, the XGBoost classifier has proper support for base margin without to need for the user to flatten the input. In this initial support, XGBoost builds one model for each target similar to the sklearn meta estimator, for more details, please see our <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/multioutput.html">quick introduction</a>.</p>
<p>(#7365, #7736, #7607, #7574, #7521, #7514, #7456, #7453, #7455, #7434, #7429, #7405, #7381)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md239"></a>
External memory support</h2>
<p>External memory support for both approx and hist tree method is considered feature complete in XGBoost 1.6. Building upon the iterator-based interface introduced in the previous version, now both <code>hist</code> and <code>approx</code> iterates over each batch of data during training and prediction. In previous versions, <code>hist</code> concatenates all the batches into an internal representation, which is removed in this version. As a result, users can expect higher scalability in terms of data size but might experience lower performance due to disk IO. (#7531, #7320, #7638, #7372)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md240"></a>
Rewritten approx</h2>
<p>The <code>approx</code> tree method is rewritten based on the existing <code>hist</code> tree method. The rewrite closes the feature gap between <code>approx</code> and <code>hist</code> and improves the performance. Now the behavior of <code>approx</code> should be more aligned with <code>hist</code> and <code>gpu_hist</code>. Here is a list of user-visible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports both <code>max_leaves</code> and <code>max_depth</code>.</li>
<li>Supports <code>grow_policy</code>.</li>
<li>Supports monotonic constraint.</li>
<li>Supports feature weights.</li>
<li>Use <code>max_bin</code> to replace <code>sketch_eps</code>.</li>
<li>Supports categorical data.</li>
<li>Faster performance for many of the datasets.</li>
<li>Improved performance and robustness for distributed training.</li>
<li>Supports prediction cache.</li>
<li>Significantly better performance for external memory when <code>depthwise</code> policy is used.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md241"></a>
New serialization format</h2>
<p>Based on the existing JSON serialization format, we introduce UBJSON support as a more efficient alternative. Both formats will be available in the future and we plan to gradually <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/7547">phase out</a> support for the old binary model format. Users can opt to use the different formats in the serialization function by providing the file extension <code>json</code> or <code>ubj</code>. Also, the <code>save_raw</code> function in all supported languages bindings gains a new parameter for exporting the model in different formats, available options are <code>json</code>, <code>ubj</code>, and <code>deprecated</code>, see document for the language binding you are using for details. Lastly, the default internal serialization format is set to UBJSON, which affects Python pickle and R RDS. (#7572, #7570, #7358, #7571, #7556, #7549, #7416)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md242"></a>
General new features and improvements</h2>
<p>Aside from the major new features mentioned above, some others are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can now access the build information of XGBoost binary in Python and C interface. (#7399, #7553)</li>
<li>Auto-configuration of <code>seed_per_iteration</code> is removed, now distributed training should generate closer results to single node training when sampling is used. (#7009)</li>
<li>A new parameter <code>huber_slope</code> is introduced for the <code>Pseudo-Huber</code> objective.</li>
<li>During source build, XGBoost can choose cub in the system path automatically. (#7579)</li>
<li>XGBoost now honors the CPU counts from CFS, which is usually set in docker environments. (#7654, #7704)</li>
<li>The metric <code>aucpr</code> is rewritten for better performance and GPU support. (#7297, #7368)</li>
<li>Metric calculation is now performed in double precision. (#7364)</li>
<li>XGBoost no longer mutates the global OpenMP thread limit. (#7537, #7519, #7608, #7590, #7589, #7588, #7687)</li>
<li>The default behavior of <code>max_leave</code> and <code>max_depth</code> is now unified (#7302, #7551).</li>
<li>CUDA fat binary is now compressed. (#7601)</li>
<li>Deterministic result for evaluation metric and linear model. In previous versions of XGBoost, evaluation results might differ slightly for each run due to parallel reduction for floating-point values, which is now addressed. (#7362, #7303, #7316, #7349)</li>
<li>XGBoost now uses double for GPU Hist node sum, which improves the accuracy of <code>gpu_hist</code>. (#7507)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md243"></a>
Performance improvements</h2>
<p>Most of the performance improvements are integrated into other refactors during feature developments. The <code>approx</code> should see significant performance gain for many datasets as mentioned in the previous section, while the <code>hist</code> tree method also enjoys improved performance with the removal of the internal <code>pruner</code> along with some other refactoring. Lastly, <code>gpu_hist</code> no longer synchronizes the device during training. (#7737)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md244"></a>
General bug fixes</h2>
<p>This section lists bug fixes that are not specific to any language binding.</p><ul>
<li>The <code>num_parallel_tree</code> is now a model parameter instead of a training hyper-parameter, which fixes model IO with random forest. (#7751)</li>
<li>Fixes in CMake script for exporting configuration. (#7730)</li>
<li>XGBoost can now handle unsorted sparse input. This includes text file formats like libsvm and scipy sparse matrix where column index might not be sorted. (#7731)</li>
<li>Fix tree param feature type, this affects inputs with the number of columns greater than the maximum value of int32. (#7565)</li>
<li>Fix external memory with gpu_hist and subsampling. (#7481)</li>
<li>Check the number of trees in inplace predict, this avoids a potential segfault when an incorrect value for <code>iteration_range</code> is provided. (#7409)</li>
<li>Fix non-stable result in cox regression (#7756)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md245"></a>
Changes in the Python package</h2>
<p>Other than the changes in Dask, the XGBoost Python package gained some new features and improvements along with small bug fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.7 is required as the lowest Python version. (#7682)</li>
<li>Pre-built binary wheel for Apple Silicon. (#7621, #7612, #7747) Apple Silicon users will now be able to run <code>pip install xgboost</code> to install XGBoost.</li>
<li>MacOS users no longer need to install <code>libomp</code> from Homebrew, as the XGBoost wheel now bundles <code>libomp.dylib</code> library.</li>
<li>There are new parameters for users to specify the custom metric with new behavior. XGBoost can now output transformed prediction values when a custom objective is not supplied. See our explanation in the <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/custom_metric_obj.html#reverse-link-function">tutorial</a> for details.</li>
<li>For the sklearn interface, following the estimator guideline from scikit-learn, all parameters in <code>fit</code> that are not related to input data are moved into the constructor and can be set by <code>set_params</code>. (#6751, #7420, #7375, #7369)</li>
<li>Apache arrow format is now supported, which can bring better performance to users' pipeline (#7512)</li>
<li>Pandas nullable types are now supported (#7760)</li>
<li>A new function <code>get_group</code> is introduced for <code>DMatrix</code> to allow users to get the group information in the custom objective function. (#7564)</li>
<li>More training parameters are exposed in the sklearn interface instead of relying on the <code>**kwargs</code>. (#7629)</li>
<li>A new attribute <code>feature_names_in_</code> is defined for all sklearn estimators like <code>XGBRegressor</code> to follow the convention of sklearn. (#7526)</li>
<li>More work on Python type hint. (#7432, #7348, #7338, #7513, #7707)</li>

v1.5.0 (2021 Oct 11)</h1>
<p>This release comes with many exciting new features and optimizations, along with some bug fixes. We will describe the experimental categorical data support and the external memory interface independently. Package-specific new features will be listed in respective sections.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md254"></a>
Development on categorical data support</h2>
<p>In version 1.3, XGBoost introduced an experimental feature for handling categorical data natively, without one-hot encoding. XGBoost can fit categorical splits in decision trees. (Currently, the generated splits will be of form <code>x \in {v}</code>, where the input is compared to a single category value. A future version of XGBoost will generate splits that compare the input against a list of multiple category values.)</p>
<p>Most of the other features, including prediction, SHAP value computation, feature importance, and model plotting were revised to natively handle categorical splits. Also, all Python interfaces including native interface with and without quantized <code>DMatrix</code>, scikit-learn interface, and Dask interface now accept categorical data with a wide range of data structures support including numpy/cupy array and cuDF/pandas/modin dataframe. In practice, the following are required for enabling categorical data support during training:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Python package.</li>
<li>Use <code>gpu_hist</code> to train the model.</li>
<li>Use JSON model file format for saving the model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the model is trained, it can be used with most of the features that are available on the Python package. For a quick introduction, see <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/categorical.html">https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/categorical.html</a></p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md255"></a>
External memory</h2>
<p>This release features a brand-new interface and implementation for external memory (also known as out-of-core training). (#6901, #7064, #7088, #7089, #7087, #7092, #7070, #7216). The new implementation leverages the data iterator interface, which is currently used to create <code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code>. For a quick introduction, see <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/external_memory.html#data-iterator">https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/external_memory.html#data-iterator</a> . During the development of this new interface, <code>lz4</code> compression is removed. (#7076). Please note that external memory support is still experimental and not ready for production use yet. All future development will focus on this new interface and users are advised to migrate. (You are using the old interface if you are using a URL suffix to use external memory.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md256"></a>

v1.4.0 (2021.04.12)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md273"></a>
Introduction of pre-built binary package for R, with GPU support</h2>
<p>Starting with release 1.4.0, users now have the option of installing <code>{xgboost}</code> without having to build it from the source. This is particularly advantageous for users who want to take advantage of the GPU algorithm (<code>gpu_hist</code>), as previously they'd have to build <code>{xgboost}</code> from the source using CMake and NVCC. Now installing <code>{xgboost}</code> with GPU support is as easy as: <code>R CMD INSTALL ./xgboost_r_gpu_linux.tar.gz</code>. (#6827)</p>
<p>See the instructions at <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html">https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md274"></a>
Improvements on prediction functions</h2>
<p>XGBoost has many prediction types including shap value computation and inplace prediction. In 1.4 we overhauled the underlying prediction functions for C API and Python API with an unified interface. (#6777, #6693, #6653, #6662, #6648, #6668, #6804)</p><ul>
<li>Starting with 1.4, sklearn interface prediction will use inplace predict by default when input data is supported.</li>
<li>Users can use inplace predict with <code>dart</code> booster and enable GPU acceleration just like <code>gbtree</code>.</li>
<li>Also all prediction functions with tree models are now thread-safe. Inplace predict is improved with <code>base_margin</code> support.</li>
<li>A new set of C predict functions are exposed in the public interface.</li>
<li>A user-visible change is a newly added parameter called <code>strict_shape</code>. See <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prediction.html">https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prediction.html</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md275"></a>
Improvement on Dask interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting with 1.4, the Dask interface is considered to be feature-complete, which means all of the models found in the single node Python interface are now supported in Dask, including but not limited to ranking and random forest. Also, the prediction function is significantly faster and supports shap value computation.<ul>
<li>Most of the parameters found in single node sklearn interface are supported by Dask interface. (#6471, #6591)</li>
<li>Implements learning to rank. On the Dask interface, we use the newly added support of query ID to enable group structure. (#6576)</li>
<li>The Dask interface has Python type hints support. (#6519)</li>
<li>All models can be safely pickled. (#6651)</li>
<li>Random forest estimators are now supported. (#6602)</li>
<li>Shap value computation is now supported. (#6575, #6645, #6614)</li>
<li>Evaluation result is printed on the scheduler process. (#6609)</li>
<li><code>DaskDMatrix</code> (and device quantile dmatrix) now accepts all meta-information. (#6601)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction optimization. We enhanced and speeded up the prediction function for the Dask interface. See the latest Dask tutorial page in our document for an overview of how you can optimize it even further. (#6650, #6645, #6648, #6668)</li>
<li>Bug fixes<ul>
<li>If you are using the latest Dask and distributed where <code>distributed.MultiLock</code> is present, XGBoost supports training multiple models on the same cluster in parallel. (#6743)</li>
<li>A bug fix for when using <code>dask.client</code> to launch async task, XGBoost might use a different client object internally. (#6722)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other improvements on documents, blogs, tutorials, and demos. (#6389, #6366, #6687, #6699, #6532, #6501)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md276"></a>
Python package</h2>
<p>With changes from Dask and general improvement on prediction, we have made some enhancements on the general Python interface and IO for booster information. Starting from 1.4, booster feature names and types can be saved into the JSON model. Also some model attributes like <code>best_iteration</code>, <code>best_score</code> are restored upon model load. On sklearn interface, some attributes are now implemented as Python object property with better documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking change: All <code>data</code> parameters in prediction functions are renamed to <code>X</code> for better compliance to sklearn estimator interface guidelines.</li>
<li>Breaking change: XGBoost used to generate some pseudo feature names with <code>DMatrix</code> when inputs like <code>np.ndarray</code> don't have column names. The procedure is removed to avoid conflict with other inputs. (#6605)</li>
<li>Early stopping with training continuation is now supported. (#6506)</li>
<li>Optional import for Dask and cuDF are now lazy. (#6522)</li>
<li>As mentioned in the prediction improvement summary, the sklearn interface uses inplace prediction whenever possible. (#6718)</li>
<li>Booster information like feature names and feature types are now saved into the JSON model file. (#6605)</li>
<li>All <code>DMatrix</code> interfaces including <code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> and counterparts in Dask interface (as mentioned in the Dask changes summary) now accept all the meta-information like <code>group</code> and <code>qid</code> in their constructor for better consistency. (#6601)</li>
<li>Booster attributes are restored upon model load so users don't have to call <code>attr</code> manually. (#6593)</li>
<li>On sklearn interface, all models accept <code>base_margin</code> for evaluation datasets. (#6591)</li>
<li>Improvements over the setup script including smaller sdist size and faster installation if the C++ library is already built (#6611, #6694, #6565).</li>
<li>Bug fixes for Python package:<ul>
<li>Don't validate feature when number of rows is 0. (#6472)</li>
<li>Move metric configuration into booster. (#6504)</li>
<li>Calling XGBModel.fit() should clear the Booster by default (#6562)</li>
<li>Support <code>_estimator_type</code>. (#6582)</li>
<li>[dask, sklearn] Fix predict proba. (#6566, #6817)</li>
<li>Restore unknown data support. (#6595)</li>
<li>Fix learning rate scheduler with cv. (#6720)</li>

<li>[python-package] Fix class Booster: feature_types = None (#6705)</li>
<li>Fix divide by 0 in feature importance when no split is found. (#6676)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>[jvm] Add ability to load booster direct from byte array (#6655)</li>
<li>[jvm-packages] JVM library loader extensions (#6630)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md278"></a>
R package</h2>
<ul>
<li>R documentation: Make construction of DMatrix consistent.</li>
<li>Fix R documentation for xgb.train. (#6764)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md279"></a>
ROC-AUC</h2>
<p>We re-implemented the ROC-AUC metric in XGBoost. The new implementation supports multi-class classification and has better support for learning to rank tasks that are not binary. Also, it has a better-defined average on distributed environments with additional handling for invalid datasets. (#6749, #6747, #6797)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md280"></a>
Global configuration.</h2>
<p>Starting from 1.4, XGBoost's Python, R and C interfaces support a new global configuration model where users can specify some global parameters. Currently, supported parameters are <code>verbosity</code> and <code>use_rmm</code>. The latter is experimental, see rmm plugin demo and related README file for details. (#6414, #6656)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md281"></a>
Other New features.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better handling for input data types that support <code>__array_interface__</code>. For some data types including GPU inputs and <code>scipy.sparse.csr_matrix</code>, XGBoost employs <code>__array_interface__</code> for processing the underlying data. Starting from 1.4, XGBoost can accept arbitrary array strides (which means column-major is supported) without making data copies, potentially reducing a significant amount of memory consumption. Also version 3 of <code>__cuda_array_interface__</code> is now supported. (#6776, #6765, #6459, #6675)</li>
<li>Improved parameter validation, now feeding XGBoost with parameters that contain whitespace will trigger an error. (#6769)</li>
<li>For Python and R packages, file paths containing the home indicator <code>~</code> are supported.</li>
<li>As mentioned in the Python changes summary, the JSON model can now save feature information of the trained booster. The JSON schema is updated accordingly. (#6605)</li>
<li>Development of categorical data support is continued. Newly added weighted data support and <code>dart</code> booster support. (#6508, #6693)</li>
<li>As mentioned in Dask change summary, ranking now supports the <code>qid</code> parameter for query groups. (#6576)</li>
<li><code>DMatrix.slice</code> can now consume a numpy array. (#6368)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md282"></a>
Other breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aside from the feature name generation, there are 2 breaking changes:<ul>
<li>Drop saving binary format for memory snapshot. (#6513, #6640)</li>
<li>Change default evaluation metric for binary:logitraw objective to logloss (#6647)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md283"></a>
CPU Optimization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aside from the general changes on predict function, some optimizations are applied on CPU implementation. (#6683, #6550, #6696, #6700)</li>
<li>Also performance for sampling initialization in <code>hist</code> is improved. (#6410)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md284"></a>
Notable fixes in the core library</h2>
<p>These fixes do not reside in particular language bindings:</p><ul>
<li>Fixes for gamma regression. This includes checking for invalid input values, fixes for gamma deviance metric, and better floating point guard for gamma negative log-likelihood metric. (#6778, #6537, #6761)</li>
<li>Random forest with <code>gpu_hist</code> might generate low accuracy in previous versions. (#6755)</li>
<li>Fix a bug in GPU sketching when data size exceeds limit of 32-bit integer. (#6826)</li>

XGBoost4J-Spark: Exceptions should cancel jobs gracefully instead of killing SparkContext (#6019).</h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, exceptions in XGBoost4J-Spark causes the whole SparkContext to shut down, necessitating the restart of the Spark cluster. This behavior is often a major inconvenience.</li>
<li>Starting from 1.3.0 release, XGBoost adds a new parameter <code>killSparkContextOnWorkerFailure</code> to optionally prevent killing SparkContext. If this parameter is set, exceptions will gracefully cancel training jobs instead of killing SparkContext.</li>

GPUTreeSHAP: GPU acceleration of the TreeSHAP algorithm (#6038, #6064, #6087, #6099, #6163, #6281, #6332)</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)</a> is a game theoretic approach to explain predictions of machine learning models. It computes feature importance scores for individual examples, establishing how each feature influences a particular prediction. TreeSHAP is an optimized SHAP algorithm specifically designed for decision tree ensembles.</li>
<li>Starting with 1.3.0 release, it is now possible to leverage CUDA-capable GPUs to accelerate the TreeSHAP algorithm. Check out <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/gpu_acceleration/shap.ipynb">the demo notebook</a>.</li>
<li>The CUDA implementation of the TreeSHAP algorithm is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/gputreeshap">rapidsai/GPUTreeSHAP</a>. XGBoost imports it as a Git submodule.</li>

New style Python callback API (#6199, #6270, #6320, #6348, #6376, #6399, #6441)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The XGBoost Python package now offers a re-designed callback API. The new callback API lets you design various extensions of training in idomatic Python. In addition, the new callback API allows you to use early stopping with the native Dask API (<code><a class="el" href="namespacexgboost_1_1dask.html">xgboost.dask</a></code>). Check out <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.3.0/python/callbacks.html">the tutorial</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/guide-python/callbacks.py">the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md294"></a>
Enable the use of &lt;tt&gt;DeviceQuantileDMatrix&lt;/tt&gt; / &lt;tt&gt;DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix&lt;/tt&gt; with large data (#6201, #6229, #6234).</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> can achieve memory saving by avoiding extra copies of the training data, and the saving is bigger for large data. Unfortunately, large data with more than 2^31 elements was triggering integer overflow bugs in CUB and Thrust. Tracking issue: #6228.</li>
<li>This release contains a series of work-arounds to allow the use of <code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> with large data:<ul>
<li>Loop over <code>copy_if</code> (#6201)</li>
<li>Loop over <code>thrust::reduce</code> (#6229)</li>
<li>Implement the inclusive scan algorithm in-house, to handle large offsets (#6234)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md295"></a>
Support slicing of tree models (#6302)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accessing the best iteration of a model after the application of early stopping used to be error-prone, need to manually pass the <code>ntree_limit</code> argument to the <code>predict()</code> function.</li>
<li>Now we provide a simple interface to slice tree models by specifying a range of boosting rounds. The tree ensemble can be split into multiple sub-ensembles via the slicing interface. Check out <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.3.0/python/model.html">an example</a>.</li>
<li>In addition, the early stopping callback now supports <code>save_best</code> option. When enabled, XGBoost will save (persist) the model at the best boosting round and discard the trees that were fit subsequent to the best round.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md296"></a>
Weighted subsampling of features (columns) (#5962)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to sample features (columns) via weighted subsampling, in which features with higher weights are more likely to be selected in the sample. Weighted subsampling allows you to encode domain knowledge by emphasizing a particular set of features in the choice of tree splits. In addition, you can prevent particular features from being used in any splits, by assigning them zero weights.</li>
<li>Check out <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/guide-python/feature_weights.py">the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md297"></a>
Improved integration with Dask</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support reverse-proxy environment such as Google Kubernetes Engine (#6343, #6475)</li>
<li>An XGBoost training job will no longer use all available workers. Instead, it will only use the workers that contain input data (#6343).</li>
<li>The new callback API works well with the Dask training API.</li>
<li>The <code>predict()</code> and <code>fit()</code> function of <code>DaskXGBClassifier</code> and <code>DaskXGBRegressor</code> now accept a base margin (#6155).</li>
<li>Support more meta data in the Dask API (#6130, #6132, #6333).</li>
<li>Allow passing extra keyword arguments as <code>kwargs</code> in <code>predict()</code> (#6117)</li>
<li>Fix typo in dask interface: <code>sample_weights</code> -&gt; <code>sample_weight</code> (#6240)</li>
<li>Allow empty data matrix in AFT survival, as Dask may produce empty partitions (#6379)</li>
<li>Speed up prediction by overlapping prediction jobs in all workers (#6412)</li>

Experimental support for direct splits with categorical features (#6028, #6128, #6137, #6140, #6164, #6165, #6166, #6179, #6194, #6219)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently, XGBoost requires users to one-hot-encode categorical variables. This has adverse performance implications, as the creation of many dummy variables results into higher memory consumption and may require fitting deeper trees to achieve equivalent model accuracy.</li>
<li>The 1.3.0 release of XGBoost contains an experimental support for direct handling of categorical variables in test nodes. Each test node will have the condition of form <code>feature_value \in match_set</code>, where the <code>match_set</code> on the right hand side contains one or more matching categories. The matching categories in <code>match_set</code> represent the condition for traversing to the right child node. Currently, XGBoost will only generate categorical splits with only a single matching category ("one-vs-rest split"). In a future release, we plan to remove this restriction and produce splits with multiple matching categories in <code>match_set</code>.</li>
<li>The categorical split requires the use of JSON model serialization. The legacy binary serialization method cannot be used to save (persist) models with categorical splits.</li>
<li>Note. This feature is currently highly experimental. Use it at your own risk. See the detailed list of limitations at <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/5949">#5949</a>.</li>

Experimental plugin for RAPIDS Memory Manager (#5873, #6131, #6146, #6150, #6182)</h2>
<ul>
<li>RAPIDS Memory Manager library (<a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm">rapidsai/rmm</a>) provides a collection of efficient memory allocators for NVIDIA GPUs. It is now possible to use XGBoost with memory allocators provided by RMM, by enabling the RMM integration plugin. With this plugin, XGBoost is now able to share a common GPU memory pool with other applications using RMM, such as the RAPIDS data science packages.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/rmm_plugin/README.md">the demo</a> for a working example, as well as directions for building XGBoost with the RMM plugin.</li>
<li>The plugin will be soon considered non-experimental, once #6297 is resolved.</li>

Experimental plugin for oneAPI programming model (#5825)</h2>
<ul>
<li>oneAPI is a programming interface developed by Intel aimed at providing one programming model for many types of hardware such as CPU, GPU, FGPA and other hardware accelerators.</li>
<li>XGBoost now includes an experimental plugin for using oneAPI for the predictor and objective functions. The plugin is hosted in the directory <code>plugin/updater_oneapi</code>.</li>

<ul>
<li>The default metric used to be accuracy, and it is not statistically consistent to perform early stopping with the accuracy metric when we are really optimizing the log loss for the <code>binary:logistic</code> objective.</li>
<li>For statistical consistency, the default metric for classification has been changed to <code>logloss</code>. Users may choose to preserve the old behavior by explicitly specifying <code>eval_metric</code>.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md315"></a>
v1.2.0 (2020.08.22)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md316"></a>
XGBoost4J-Spark now supports the GPU algorithm (#5171)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now XGBoost4J-Spark is able to leverage NVIDIA GPU hardware to speed up training.</li>
<li>There is on-going work for accelerating the rest of the data pipeline with NVIDIA GPUs (#5950, #5972).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md317"></a>
XGBoost now supports CUDA 11 (#5808)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to build XGBoost with CUDA 11. Note that we do not yet distribute pre-built binaries built with CUDA 11; all current distributions use CUDA 10.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md318"></a>
Better guidance for persisting XGBoost models in an R environment (#5940, #5964)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users are strongly encouraged to use <code>xgb.save()</code> and <code>xgb.save.raw()</code> instead of <code>saveRDS()</code>. This is so that the persisted models can be accessed with future releases of XGBoost.</li>
<li>The previous release (1.1.0) had problems loading models that were saved with <code>saveRDS()</code>. This release adds a compatibility layer to restore access to the old RDS files. Note that this is meant to be a temporary measure; users are advised to stop using <code>saveRDS()</code> and migrate to <code>xgb.save()</code> and <code>xgb.save.raw()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md319"></a>
New objectives and metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pseudo-Huber loss <code>reg:pseudohubererror</code> is added (#5647). The corresponding metric is <code>mphe</code>. Right now, the slope is hard-coded to 1.</li>
<li>The Accelerated Failure Time objective for survival analysis (<code>survival:aft</code>) is now accelerated on GPUs (#5714, #5716). The survival metrics <code>aft-nloglik</code> and <code>interval-regression-accuracy</code> are also accelerated on GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md320"></a>
Improved integration with scikit-learn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>n_features_in_</code> attribute to the scikit-learn interface to store the number of features used (#5780). This is useful for integrating with some scikit-learn features such as <code>StackingClassifier</code>. See <a href="https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep010/proposal.html">this link</a> for more details.</li>
<li><code>XGBoostError</code> now inherits <code>ValueError</code>, which conforms scikit-learn's exception requirement (#5696).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md321"></a>
Improved integration with Dask</h2>
<ul>
<li>The XGBoost Dask API now exposes an asynchronous interface (#5862). See <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dask.html#working-with-asyncio">the document</a> for details.</li>
<li>Zero-copy ingestion of GPU arrays via <code>DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> (#5623, #5799, #5800, #5803, #5837, #5874, #5901): Previously, the Dask interface had to make 2 data copies: one for concatenating the Dask partition/block into a single block and another for internal representation. To save memory, we introduce <code>DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix</code>. As long as Dask partitions are resident in the GPU memory, <code>DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix</code> is able to ingest them directly without making copies. This matrix type wraps <code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code>.</li>
<li>The prediction function now returns GPU Series type if the input is from Dask-cuDF (#5710). This is to preserve the input data type.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md322"></a>
Robust handling of external data types (#5689, #5893)</h2>
<ul>
<li>As we support more and more external data types, the handling logic has proliferated all over the code base and became hard to keep track. It also became unclear how missing values and threads are handled. We refactored the Python package code to collect all data handling logic to a central location, and now we have an explicit list of of all supported data types.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md323"></a>
Improvements in GPU-side data matrix (&lt;tt&gt;DeviceQuantileDMatrix&lt;/tt&gt;)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The GPU-side data matrix now implements its own quantile sketching logic, so that data don't have to be transported back to the main memory (#5700, #5747, #5760, #5846, #5870, #5898). The GK sketching algorithm is also now better documented.<ul>
<li>Now we can load extremely sparse dataset like URL, although performance is still sub-optimal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The GPU-side data matrix now exposes an iterative interface (#5783), so that users are able to construct a matrix from a data iterator. See the <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/release_1.2.0/demo/guide-python/data_iterator.py">Python demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md324"></a>
New language binding: Swift (#5728)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/kongzii/SwiftXGBoost">https://github.com/kongzii/SwiftXGBoost</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md325"></a>
Robust model serialization with JSON (#5772, #5804, #5831, #5857, #5934)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We continue efforts from the 1.0.0 release to adopt JSON as the format to save and load models robustly.</li>
<li>JSON model IO is significantly faster and produces smaller model files.</li>
<li>Round-trip reproducibility is guaranteed, via the introduction of an efficient float-to-string conversion algorithm known as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3192366.3192369">the Ryū algorithm</a>. The conversion is locale-independent, producing consistent numeric representation regardless of the locale setting of the user's machine.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in loading large JSON files to memory.</li>
<li>It is now possible to load a JSON file from a remote source such as S3.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md326"></a>
Performance improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>CPU hist tree method optimization<ul>
<li>Skip missing lookup in hist row partitioning if data is dense. (#5644)</li>
<li>Specialize training procedures for CPU hist tree method on distributed environment. (#5557)</li>
<li>Add single point histogram for CPU hist. Previously gradient histogram for CPU hist is hard coded to be 64 bit, now users can specify the parameter <code>single_precision_histogram</code> to use 32 bit histogram instead for faster training performance. (#5624, #5811)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GPU hist tree method optimization<ul>
<li>Removed some unnecessary synchronizations and better memory allocation pattern. (#5707)</li>
<li>Optimize GPU Hist for wide dataset. Previously for wide dataset the atomic operation is performed on global memory, now it can run on shared memory for faster histogram building. But there's a known small regression on GeForce cards with dense data. (#5795, #5926, #5948, #5631)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md327"></a>
API additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support passing fmap to importance plot (#5719). Now importance plot can show actual names of features instead of default ones.</li>
<li>Support 64bit seed. (#5643)</li>
<li>A new C API <code>XGBoosterGetNumFeature</code> is added for getting number of features in booster (#5856).</li>
<li>Feature names and feature types are now stored in C++ core and saved in binary DMatrix (#5858).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md328"></a>
Breaking: The &lt;tt&gt;predict()&lt;/tt&gt; method of &lt;tt&gt;DaskXGBClassifier&lt;/tt&gt; now produces class predictions (#5986). Use &lt;tt&gt;predict_proba()&lt;/tt&gt; to obtain probability predictions.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously, <code>DaskXGBClassifier.predict()</code> produced probability predictions. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other scikit-learn classifiers, where <code>predict()</code> returns class predictions. We make a breaking change in 1.2.0 release so that <code>DaskXGBClassifier.predict()</code> now correctly produces class predictions and thus behave like other scikit-learn classifiers. Furthermore, we introduce the <code>predict_proba()</code> method for obtaining probability predictions, again to be in line with other scikit-learn classifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md329"></a>
Breaking: Custom evaluation metric now receives raw prediction (#5954)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously, the custom evaluation metric received a transformed prediction result when used with a classifier. Now the custom metric will receive a raw (untransformed) prediction and will need to transform the prediction itself. See <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/release_1.2.0/demo/guide-python/custom_softmax.py">demo/guide-python/custom_softmax.py</a> for an example.</li>
<li>This change is to make the custom metric behave consistently with the custom objective, which already receives raw prediction (#5564).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md330"></a>
Breaking: XGBoost4J-Spark now requires Spark 3.0 and Scala 2.12 (#5836, #5890)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting with version 3.0, Spark can manage GPU resources and allocate them among executors.</li>
<li>Spark 3.0 dropped support for Scala 2.11 and now only supports Scala 2.12. Thus, XGBoost4J-Spark also only supports Scala 2.12.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md331"></a>
Breaking: XGBoost Python package now requires Python 3.6 and later (#5715)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6 has many useful features such as f-strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md332"></a>
Breaking: XGBoost now adopts the C++14 standard (#5664)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to use a sufficiently modern C++ compiler that supports C++14, such as Visual Studio 2017, GCC 5.0+, and Clang 3.4+.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md333"></a>
Bug-fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a data race in the prediction function (#5853). As a byproduct, the prediction function now uses a thread-local data store and became thread-safe.</li>
<li>Restore capability to run prediction when the test input has fewer features than the training data (#5955). This capability is necessary to support predicting with LIBSVM inputs. The previous release (1.1) had broken this capability, so we restore it in this version with better tests.</li>
<li>Fix OpenMP build with CMake for R package, to support CMake 3.13 (#5895).</li>
<li>Fix Windows 2016 build (#5902, #5918).</li>
<li>Fix edge cases in scikit-learn interface with Pandas input by disabling feature validation. (#5953)</li>
<li>[R] Enable weighted learning to rank (#5945)</li>
<li>[R] Fix early stopping with custom objective (#5923)</li>
<li>Fix NDK Build (#5886)</li>
<li>Add missing explicit template specializations for greater portability (#5921)</li>
<li>Handle empty rows in data iterators correctly (#5929). This bug affects file loader and JVM data frames.</li>
<li>Fix <code>IsDense</code> (#5702)</li>
<li>[jvm-packages] Fix wrong method name <code>setAllowZeroForMissingValue</code> (#5740)</li>
<li>Fix shape inference for Dask predict (#5989)</li>
</ul>

Usability Improvements, Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>[Doc] Document that CUDA 10.0 is required (#5872)</li>
<li>Refactored command line interface (CLI). Now CLI is able to handle user errors and output basic document. (#5574)</li>
<li>Better error handling in Python: use <code>raise from</code> syntax to preserve full stacktrace (#5787).</li>
<li>The JSON model dump now has a formal schema (#5660, #5818). The benefit is to prevent <code>dump_model()</code> function from breaking. See <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html#difference-between-saving-model-and-dumping-model">this document</a> to understand the difference between saving and dumping models.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md338"></a>
v1.1.1 (2020.06.06)</h1>
<p>This patch release applies the following patches to 1.1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU performance improvement in the PyPI wheels (#5720)</li>
<li>Fix loading old model (#5724)</li>
<li>Install pkg-config file (#5744)</li>

v1.1.0 (2020.05.17)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md340"></a>
Better performance on multi-core CPUs (#5244, #5334, #5522)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poor performance scaling of the <code>hist</code> algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). #5244 concludes the ongoing effort to improve performance scaling on multi-CPUs, in particular Intel CPUs. Roadmap: #5104</li>
<li>#5334 makes steps toward reducing memory consumption for the <code>hist</code> tree method on CPU.</li>
<li>#5522 optimizes random number generation for data sampling.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md341"></a>
Deterministic GPU algorithm for regression and classification (#5361)</h2>
<ul>
<li>GPU algorithm for regression and classification tasks is now deterministic.</li>
<li>Roadmap: #5023. Currently only single-GPU training is deterministic. Distributed training with multiple GPUs is not yet deterministic.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md342"></a>
Improve external memory support on GPUs (#5093, #5365)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starting from 1.0.0 release, we added support for external memory on GPUs to enable training with larger datasets. Gradient-based sampling (#5093) speeds up the external memory algorithm by intelligently sampling a subset of the training data to copy into the GPU memory. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09148">Learn more about out-of-core GPU gradient boosting.</a></li>
<li>GPU-side data sketching now works with data from external memory (#5365).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md343"></a>
Parameter validation: detection of unused or incorrect parameters (#5477, #5569, #5508)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mis-spelled training parameter is a common user mistake. In previous versions of XGBoost, mis-spelled parameters were silently ignored. Starting with 1.0.0 release, XGBoost will produce a warning message if there is any unused training parameters. The 1.1.0 release makes parameter validation available to the scikit-learn interface (#5477) and the R binding (#5569).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md344"></a>
Thread-safe, in-place prediction method (#5389, #5512)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously, the prediction method was not thread-safe (#5339). This release adds a new API function <code>inplace_predict()</code> that is thread-safe. It is now possible to serve concurrent requests for prediction using a shared model object.</li>
<li>It is now possible to compute prediction in-place for selected data formats (<code>numpy.ndarray</code> / <code>scipy.sparse.csr_matrix</code> / <code>cupy.ndarray</code> / <code>cudf.DataFrame</code> / <code>pd.DataFrame</code>) without creating a <code>DMatrix</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md345"></a>
Addition of Accelerated Failure Time objective for survival analysis (#4763, #5473, #5486, #5552, #5553)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Survival analysis (regression) models the time it takes for an event of interest to occur. The target label is potentially censored, i.e. the label is a range rather than a single number. We added a new objective <code>survival:aft</code> to support survival analysis. Also added is the new API to specify the ranged labels. Check out <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.1.0/tutorials/aft_survival_analysis.html">the tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/release_1.1.0/demo/aft_survival">demos</a>.</li>
<li>GPU support is work in progress (#5714).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md346"></a>
Improved installation experience on Mac OSX (#5597, #5602, #5606, #5701)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It only takes two commands to install the XGBoost Python package: <code>brew install libomp</code> followed by <code>pip install xgboost</code>. The installed XGBoost will use all CPU cores. Even better, starting with this release, we distribute pre-compiled binary wheels targeting Mac OSX. Now the install command <code>pip install xgboost</code> finishes instantly, as it no longer compiles the C++ source of XGBoost. The last three Mac versions (High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina) are supported.</li>
<li>R package: the 1.1.0 release fixes the error <code>Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized</code> (#5701)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md347"></a>
Ranking metrics are now accelerated on GPUs (#5380, #5387, #5398)</h2>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md348"></a>
GPU-side data matrix to ingest data directly from other GPU libraries (#5420, #5465)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously, data on GPU memory had to be copied back to the main memory before it could be used by XGBoost. Starting with 1.1.0 release, XGBoost provides a dedicated interface (<code>DeviceQuantileDMatrix</code>) so that it can ingest data from GPU memory directly. The result is that XGBoost interoperates better with GPU-accelerated data science libraries, such as cuDF, cuPy, and PyTorch.</li>

XGBoost4J-Spark: Check number of columns in the data iterator (#5202, #5303)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before, the native layer in XGBoost did not know the number of columns (features) ahead of time and had to guess the number of columns by counting the feature index when ingesting data. This method has a failure more in distributed setting: if the training data is highly sparse, some features may be completely missing in one or more worker partitions. Thus, one or more workers may deduce an incorrect data shape, leading to crashes or silently wrong models.</li>
<li>Enforce correct data shape by passing the number of columns explicitly from the JVM layer into the native layer.</li>

Breaking: XGBoost Python package now requires Pip 19.0 and higher (#5589)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your Linux machine may have an old version of Pip and may attempt to install a source package, leading to long installation time. This is because we are now using <code>manylinux2010</code> tag in the binary wheel release. Ensure you have Pip 19.0 or newer by running <code>python3 -m pip -V</code> to check the version. Upgrade Pip with command <div class="fragment"><div class="line">python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> Upgrading to latest pip allows us to depend on newer versions of system libraries. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip">TensorFlow</a> also requires Pip 19.0+.</li>

Deprecation notices</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Python 3.5</b>. This release is the last release to support Python 3.5. The following release (1.2.0) will require Python 3.6.</li>
<li><b>Scala 2.11</b>. Currently XGBoost4J supports Scala 2.11. However, if a future release of XGBoost adopts Spark 3, it will not support Scala 2.11, as Spark 3 requires Scala 2.12+. We do not yet know which XGBoost release will adopt Spark 3.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md360"></a>
Known limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Python package) When early stopping is activated with <code>early_stopping_rounds</code> at training time, the prediction method (<code>xgb.predict()</code>) behaves in a surprising way. If XGBoost runs for M rounds and chooses iteration N (N &lt; M) as the best iteration, then the prediction method will use M trees by default. To use the best iteration (N trees), users will need to manually take the best iteration field <code>bst.best_iteration</code> and pass it as the <code>ntree_limit</code> argument to <code>xgb.predict()</code>. See #5209 and #4052 for additional context.</li>
<li>GPU ranking objective is currently not deterministic (#5561).</li>
<li>When training parameter <code>reg_lambda</code> is set to zero, some leaf nodes may be assigned a NaN value. (See <a href="https://discuss.xgboost.ai/t/still-getting-unexplained-nans-new-replication-code/1383/9">discussion</a>.) For now, please set <code>reg_lambda</code> to a nonzero value.</li>

Better performance scaling for multi-core CPUs (#4502, #4529, #4716, #4851, #5008, #5107, #5138, #5156)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poor performance scaling of the <code>hist</code> algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). Previous effort #4529 was replaced with a series of pull requests (#5107, #5138, #5156) aimed at achieving the same performance benefits while keeping the C++ codebase legible. The latest performance benchmark results show <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/5156#issuecomment-580024413">up to 5x speedup on Intel CPUs with many cores</a>. Note: #5244, which concludes the effort, will become part of the upcoming release 1.1.0.</li>

Improved installation experience on Mac OSX (#4672, #5074, #5080, #5146, #5240)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It used to be quite complicated to install XGBoost on Mac OSX. XGBoost uses OpenMP to distribute work among multiple CPU cores, and Mac's default C++ compiler (Apple Clang) does not come with OpenMP. Existing work-around (using another C++ compiler) was complex and prone to fail with cryptic diagnosis (#4933, #4949, #4969).</li>
<li>Now it only takes two commands to install XGBoost: <code>brew install libomp</code> followed by <code>pip install xgboost</code>. The installed XGBoost will use all CPU cores.</li>
<li>Even better, XGBoost is now available from Homebrew: <code>brew install xgboost</code>. See Homebrew/homebrew-core#50467.</li>
<li>Previously, if you installed the XGBoost R package using the command &lsquo;install.packages('xgboost&rsquo;)`, it could only use a single CPU core and you would experience slow training performance. With 1.0.0 release, the R package will use all CPU cores out of box.</li>

XGBoost4J-Spark: Redesigning checkpointing mechanism</h2>
<ul>
<li>RFC is available at #4786</li>
<li>Clean up checkpoint file after a successful training job (#4754): The current implementation in XGBoost4J-Spark does not clean up the checkpoint file after a successful training job. If the user runs another job with the same checkpointing directory, she will get a wrong model because the second job will re-use the checkpoint file left over from the first job. To prevent this scenario, we propose to always clean up the checkpoint file after every successful training job.</li>
<li>Avoid Multiple Jobs for Checkpointing (#5082): The current method for checkpoint is to collect the booster produced at the last iteration of each checkpoint internal to Driver and persist it in HDFS. The major issue with this approach is that it needs to re-perform the data preparation for training if the user did not choose to cache the training dataset. To avoid re-performing data prep, we build external-memory checkpointing in the XGBoost4J layer as well.</li>
<li>Enable deterministic repartitioning when checkpoint is enabled (#4807): Distributed algorithm for gradient boosting assumes a fixed partition of the training data between multiple iterations. In previous versions, there was no guarantee that data partition would stay the same, especially when a worker goes down and some data had to recovered from previous checkpoint. In this release, we make data partition deterministic by using the data hash value of each data row in computing the partition.</li>

XGBoost4J-Spark: handle errors thrown by the native code (#4560)</h2>
<ul>
<li>All core logic of XGBoost is written in C++, so XGBoost4J-Spark internally uses the C++ code via Java Native Interface (JNI). #4560 adds a proper error handling for any errors or exceptions arising from the C++ code, so that the XGBoost Spark application can be torn down in an orderly fashion.</li>

XGBoost4J-Spark: Refine method to count the number of alive cores  (#4858)</h2>

Robust model serialization with JSON (#4632, #4708, #4739, #4868, #4936, #4945, #4974, #5086, #5087, #5089, #5091, #5094, #5110, #5111, #5112, #5120, #5137, #5218, #5222, #5236, #5245, #5248, #5281)</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this release, we introduce an experimental support of using <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> for serializing (saving/loading) XGBoost models and related hyperparameters for training. We would like to eventually replace the old binary format with JSON, since it is an open format and parsers are available in many programming languages and platforms. See <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/tutorials/saving_model.html">the documentation for model I/O using JSON</a>. #3980 explains why JSON was chosen over other alternatives.</li>
<li><p class="startli">To maximize interoperability and compatibility of the serialized models, we now split serialization into two parts (#4855):</p><ol type="1">
<li>Model, e.g. decision trees and strictly related metadata like <code>num_features</code>.</li>
<li>Internal configuration, consisting of training parameters and other configurable parameters. For example, <code>max_delta_step</code>, <code>tree_method</code>, <code>objective</code>, <code>predictor</code>, <code>gpu_id</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="startli">Previously, users often ran into issues where the model file produced by one machine could not load or run on another machine. For example, models trained using a machine with an NVIDIA GPU could not run on another machine without a GPU (#5291, #5234). The reason is that the old binary format saved some internal configuration that were not universally applicable to all machines, e.g. &lsquo;predictor='gpu_predictor&rsquo;`.</p>
<p class="startli">Now, model saving function (<code>Booster.save_model()</code> in Python) will save only the model, without internal configuration. This will guarantee that your model file would be used anywhere. Internal configuration will be serialized in limited circumstances such as:</p><ul>
<li>Multiple nodes in a distributed system exchange model details over the network.</li>
<li>Model checkpointing, to recover from possible crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">This work proved to be useful for parameter validation as well (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>Starting with 1.0.0 release, we will use semantic versioning to indicate whether the model produced by one version of XGBoost would be compatible with another version of XGBoost. Any change in the major version indicates a breaking change in the serialization format.</li>
<li>We now provide a robust method to save and load scikit-learn related attributes (#5245). Previously, we used Python pickle to save Python attributes related to <code>XGBClassifier</code>, <code>XGBRegressor</code>, and <code>XGBRanker</code> objects. The attributes are necessary to properly interact with scikit-learn. See #4639 for more details. The use of pickling hampered interoperability, as a pickle from one machine may not necessarily work on another machine. Starting with this release, we use an alternative method to serialize the scikit-learn related attributes. The use of Python pickle is now discouraged (#5236, #5281).</li>
</ul>

Parameter validation: detection of unused or incorrect parameters (#4553, #4577, #4738, #4801, #4961, #5101, #5157, #5167, #5256)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mis-spelled training parameter is a common user mistake. In previous versions of XGBoost, mis-spelled parameters were silently ignored. Starting with 1.0.0 release, XGBoost will produce a warning message if there is any unused training parameters. Currently, parameter validation is available to R users and Python XGBoost API users. We are working to extend its support to scikit-learn users.</li>
<li>Configuration steps now have well-defined semantics (#4542, #4738), so we know exactly where and how the internal configurable parameters are changed.</li>
<li>The user can now use <code>save_config()</code> function to inspect all (used) training parameters. This is helpful for debugging model performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md390"></a>
Allow individual workers to recover from faults (#4808, #4966)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Status quo: if a worker fails, all workers are shut down and restarted, and learning resumes from the last checkpoint. This involves requesting resources from the scheduler (e.g. Spark) and shuffling all the data again from scratch. Both of these operations can be quite costly and block training for extended periods of time, especially if the training data is big and the number of worker nodes is in the hundreds.</li>
<li>The proposed solution is to recover the single node that failed, instead of shutting down all workers. The rest of the clusters wait until the single failed worker is bootstrapped and catches up with the rest.</li>
<li>See roadmap at #4753. Note that this is work in progress. In particular, the feature is not yet available from XGBoost4J-Spark.</li>

<ul>
<li>Goal 1: improve performance and reduce memory consumption. Right now, if the user trains a model with a NumPy array as training data, the array gets copies 2-3 times before training begins. We'd like to reduce duplication of the data matrix.</li>
<li>Goal 2: Expose a common interface to external data, unify the way DMatrix objects are constructed and simplify the process of adding new external data sources. This work is essential for ingesting cuPy arrays.</li>
<li>Goal 3: Handle missing values consistently.</li>

<ul>
<li>#4531 proposed removing support for single-process multi-GPU training. Contributors would focus on multi-GPU support through distributed frameworks such as Dask and Spark, where the framework would be expected to assign a worker process for each GPU independently. By delegating GPU management and data movement to the distributed framework, we can greatly simplify the core XGBoost codebase, make multi-GPU training more robust, and reduce burden for future development.</li>

XGBoost Python package drops Python 2.x (#4379, #4381)</h2>
<p>Python 2.x is reaching its end-of-life at the end of this year. <a href="https://python3statement.org/">Many scientific Python packages are now moving to drop Python 2.x</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md409"></a>
XGBoost4J-Spark now requires Spark 2.4.x (#4377)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spark 2.3 is reaching its end-of-life soon. See discussion at #4389.</li>
<li><b>Consistent handling of missing values</b> (#4309, #4349, #4411): Many users had reported issue with inconsistent predictions between XGBoost4J-Spark and the Python XGBoost package. The issue was caused by Spark mis-handling non-zero missing values (NaN, -1, 999 etc). We now alert the user whenever Spark doesn't handle missing values correctly (#4309, #4349). See <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.90/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html#dealing-with-missing-values">the tutorial for dealing with missing values in XGBoost4J-Spark</a>. This fix also depends on the availability of Spark 2.4.x.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md424"></a>
v0.82 (2019.03.03)</h1>
<p>This release is packed with many new features and bug fixes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md425"></a>
Roadmap: better performance scaling for multi-core CPUs (#3957)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poor performance scaling of the <code>hist</code> algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). #3957 marks an important step toward better performance scaling, by using software pre-fetching and replacing STL vectors with C-style arrays. Special thanks to @Laurae2 and @SmirnovEgorRu.</li>
<li>See #3810 for latest progress on this roadmap.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md426"></a>
New feature: Distributed Fast Histogram Algorithm (&lt;tt&gt;hist&lt;/tt&gt;) (#4011, #4102, #4140, #4128)</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to run the <code>hist</code> algorithm in distributed setting. Special thanks to @CodingCat. The benefits include:<ol type="1">
<li>Faster local computation via feature binning</li>
<li>Support for monotonic constraints and feature interaction constraints</li>
<li>Simpler codebase than <code>approx</code>, allowing for future improvement</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Depth-wise tree growing is now performed in a separate code path, so that cross-node syncronization is performed only once per level.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md427"></a>
New feature: Multi-Node, Multi-GPU training (#4095)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Distributed training is now able to utilize clusters equipped with NVIDIA GPUs. In particular, the rabit AllReduce layer will communicate GPU device information. Special thanks to @mt-jones, @RAMitchell, @rongou, @trivialfis, @canonizer, and @jeffdk.</li>
<li>Resource management systems will be able to assign a rank for each GPU in the cluster.</li>
<li>In Dask, users will be able to construct a collection of XGBoost processes over an inhomogeneous device cluster (i.e. workers with different number and/or kinds of GPUs).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md428"></a>
New feature: Multiple validation datasets in XGBoost4J-Spark (#3904, #3910)</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now track the performance of the model during training with multiple evaluation datasets. By specifying <code>eval_sets</code> or call <code>setEvalSets</code> over a <code>XGBoostClassifier</code> or <code>XGBoostRegressor</code>, you can pass in multiple evaluation datasets typed as a <code>Map</code> from <code>String</code> to <code>DataFrame</code>. Special thanks to @CodingCat.</li>
<li>See the usage of multiple validation datasets <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/0c1d5f1120c0a159f2567b267f0ec4ffadee00d0/jvm-packages/xgboost4j-example/src/main/scala/ml/dmlc/xgboost4j/scala/example/spark/SparkTraining.scala#L66-L78">here</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md429"></a>
New feature: Additional metric functions for GPUs (#3952)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Element-wise metrics have been ported to GPU: <code>rmse</code>, <code>mae</code>, <code>logloss</code>, <code>poisson-nloglik</code>, <code>gamma-deviance</code>, <code>gamma-nloglik</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>tweedie-nloglik</code>. Special thanks to @trivialfis and @RAMitchell.</li>
<li>With supported metrics, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and <code>n_gpus</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md430"></a>
New feature: Column sampling at individual nodes (splits) (#3971)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Columns (features) can now be sampled at individual tree nodes, in addition to per-tree and per-level sampling. To enable per-node sampling, set <code>colsample_bynode</code> parameter, which represents the fraction of columns sampled at each node. This parameter is set to 1.0 by default (i.e. no sampling per node). Special thanks to @canonizer.</li>
<li>The <code>colsample_bynode</code> parameter works cumulatively with other <code>colsample_by*</code> parameters: for example, &lsquo;{'colsample_bynode&rsquo;:0.5, 'colsample_bytree':0.5}` with 100 columns will give 25 features to choose from at each split.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md431"></a>
Major API change: consistent logging level via &lt;tt&gt;verbosity&lt;/tt&gt; (#3982, #4002, #4138)</h2>
<ul>
<li>XGBoost now allows fine-grained control over logging. You can set <code>verbosity</code> to 0 (silent), 1 (warning), 2 (info), and 3 (debug). This is useful for controlling the amount of logging outputs. Special thanks to @trivialfis.</li>
<li>Parameters <code>silent</code> and <code>debug_verbose</code> are now deprecated.</li>
<li>Note: Sometimes XGBoost tries to change configurations based on heuristics, which is displayed as warning message. If there's unexpected behaviour, please try to increase value of verbosity.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md432"></a>
Major bug fix: external memory (#4040, #4193)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clarify object ownership in multi-threaded prefetcher, to avoid memory error.</li>
<li>Correctly merge two column batches (which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_column_(CSC_or_CCS)">CSC layout</a>).</li>
<li>Add unit tests for external memory.</li>
<li>Special thanks to @trivialfis and @hcho3.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md433"></a>
Major bug fix: early stopping fixed in XGBoost4J and XGBoost4J-Spark (#3928, #4176)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early stopping in XGBoost4J and XGBoost4J-Spark is now consistent with its counterpart in the Python package. Training stops if the current iteration is <code>earlyStoppingSteps</code> away from the best iteration. If there are multiple evaluation sets, only the last one is used to determinate early stop.</li>
<li>See the updated documentation <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.82/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html#early-stopping">here</a></li>
<li>Special thanks to @CodingCat, @yanboliang, and @mingyang.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md434"></a>
Major bug fix: infrequent features should not crash distributed training (#4045)</h2>
<ul>
<li>For infrequently occuring features, some partitions may not get any instance. This scenario used to crash distributed training due to mal-formed ranges. The problem has now been fixed.</li>
<li>In practice, one-hot-encoded categorical variables tend to produce rare features, particularly when the cardinality is high.</li>
<li>Special thanks to @CodingCat.</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md443"></a>
New feature: feature interaction constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users are now able to control which features (independent variables) are allowed to interact by specifying feature interaction constraints (#3466).</li>
<li><a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.81/tutorials/feature_interaction_constraint.html">Tutorial</a> is available, as well as <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/R-package/demo/interaction_constraints.R">R</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/tests/python/test_interaction_constraints.py">Python</a> examples.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md444"></a>
New feature: learning to rank using scikit-learn interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learning to rank task is now available for the scikit-learn interface of the Python package (#3560, #3848). It is now possible to integrate the XGBoost ranking model into the scikit-learn learning pipeline.</li>
<li>Examples of using <code>XGBRanker</code> class is found at <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/24a268a2e3cb17302db3d72da8f04016b7d352d9/demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py">demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md445"></a>
New feature: R interface for SHAP interactions</h2>
<ul>
<li>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. Previously, this feature was only available from the Python package; now it is available from the R package as well (#3636).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md446"></a>
New feature: GPU predictor now use multiple GPUs to predict</h2>
<ul>
<li>GPU predictor is now able to utilize multiple GPUs at once to accelerate prediction (#3738)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md447"></a>
New feature: Scale distributed XGBoost to large-scale clusters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix OS file descriptor limit assertion error on large cluster (#3835, dmlc/rabit#73) by replacing <code>select()</code> based AllReduce/Broadcast with <code>poll()</code> based implementation.</li>
<li>Mitigate tracker "thundering herd" issue on large cluster. Add exponential backoff retry when workers connect to tracker.</li>
<li>With this change, we were able to scale to 1.5k executors on a 12 billion row dataset after some tweaks here and there.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md448"></a>
New feature: Additional objective functions for GPUs</h2>
<ul>
<li>New objective functions ported to GPU: <code>hinge</code>, <code>multi:softmax</code>, <code>multi:softprob</code>, <code>count:poisson</code>, <code>reg:gamma</code>, <code>"reg:tweedie&lt;/tt&gt;.
* With supported objectives, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and &lt;tt&gt;n_gpus&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.

@subsection autotoc_md449 Major bug fix: learning to rank with XGBoost4J-Spark
* Previously, &lt;tt&gt;repartitionForData&lt;/tt&gt; would shuffle data and lose ordering necessary for ranking task.
* To fix this issue, data points within each RDD partition is explicitly group by their group (query session) IDs (#3654). Also handle empty RDD partition carefully (#3750).

@subsection autotoc_md450 Major bug fix: early stopping fixed in XGBoost4J-Spark
* Earlier implementation of early stopping had incorrect semantics and didn't let users to specify direction for optimizing (maximize / minimize)
* A parameter &lt;tt&gt;maximize_evaluation_metrics&lt;/tt&gt; is defined so as to tell whether a metric should be maximized or minimized as part of early stopping criteria (#3808). Also early stopping now has correct semantics.

@subsection autotoc_md451 API changes
* Column sampling by level (&lt;tt&gt;colsample_bylevel&lt;/tt&gt;) is now functional for &lt;tt&gt;hist&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm (#3635, #3862)

@section autotoc_md461 v0.80 (2018.08.13)
* &lt;strong&gt;JVM packages received a major upgrade&lt;/strong&gt;: To consolidate the APIs and improve the user experience, we refactored the design of XGBoost4J-Spark in a significant manner. (#3387)
  - Consolidated APIs: It is now much easier to integrate XGBoost models into a Spark ML pipeline. Users can control behaviors like output leaf prediction results by setting corresponding column names. Training is now more consistent with other Estimators in Spark MLLIB: there is now one single method &lt;tt&gt;fit()&lt;/tt&gt; to train decision trees.
  - Better user experience: we refactored the parameters relevant modules in XGBoost4J-Spark to provide both camel-case (Spark ML style) and underscore (XGBoost style) parameters
  - A brand-new tutorial is &lt;a href="<a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html">https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html</a>" &gt;available&lt;/a&gt; for XGBoost4J-Spark.
  - Latest API documentation is now hosted at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/.
* XGBoost documentation now keeps track of multiple versions:
  - Latest master: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest
  - 0.80 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80
  - 0.72 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.72
* Support for per-group weights in ranking objective (#3379)
* Fix inaccurate decimal parsing (#3546)
* New functionality
  - Query ID column support in LIBSVM data files (#2749). This is convenient for performing ranking task in distributed setting.
  - Hinge loss for binary classification (&lt;tt&gt;binary:hinge&lt;/tt&gt;) (#3477)
  - Ability to specify delimiter and instance weight column for CSV files (#3546)
  - Ability to use 1-based indexing instead of 0-based (#3546)
* GPU support
  - Quantile sketch, binning, and index compression are now performed on GPU, eliminating PCIe transfer for 'gpu_hist' algorithm (#3319, #3393)
  - Upgrade to NCCL2 for multi-GPU training (#3404).
  - Use shared memory atomics for faster training (#3384).
  - Dynamically allocate GPU memory, to prevent large allocations for deep trees (#3519)
  - Fix memory copy bug for large files (#3472)
* Python package
  - Importing data from Python datatable (#3272)
  - Pre-built binary wheels available for 64-bit Linux and Windows (#3424, #3443)
  - Add new importance measures 'total_gain', 'total_cover' (#3498)
  - Sklearn API now supports saving and loading models (#3192)
  - Arbitrary cross validation fold indices (#3353)
  - &lt;tt&gt;predict()&lt;/tt&gt; function in Sklearn API uses &lt;tt&gt;best_ntree_limit&lt;/tt&gt; if available, to make early stopping easier to use (#3445)
  - Informational messages are now directed to Python's &lt;tt&gt;print()&lt;/tt&gt; rather than standard output (#3438). This way, messages appear inside Jupyter notebooks.
* R package
  - Oracle Solaris support, per CRAN policy (#3372)
* JVM packages
  - Single-instance prediction (#3464)
  - Pre-built JARs are now available from Maven Central (#3401)
  - Add NULL pointer check (#3021)
  - Consider &lt;tt&gt;spark.task.cpus&lt;/tt&gt; when controlling parallelism (#3530)
  - Handle missing values in prediction (#3529)
  - Eliminate outputs of &lt;tt&gt;System.out&lt;/tt&gt; (#3572)
* Refactored C++ DMatrix class for simplicity and de-duplication (#3301)
* Refactored C++ histogram facilities (#3564)
* Refactored constraints / regularization mechanism for split finding (#3335, #3429). Users may specify an elastic net (L2 + L1 regularization) on leaf weights as well as monotonic constraints on test nodes. The refactor will be useful for a future addition of feature interaction constraints.
* Statically link &lt;tt&gt;libstdc++&lt;/tt&gt; for MinGW32 (#3430)
* Enable loading from &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;base_margin&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;weight&lt;/tt&gt; (see &lt;a href="<a href="http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/input_format.html#auxiliary-files-for-additional-information">http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/input_format.html#auxiliary-files-for-additional-information</a>" &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) for Python, R, and JVM packages (#3431)

* Fix loading of sparse CSC matrix (#3553)
* Fix incorrect handling of &lt;tt&gt;base_score&lt;/tt&gt; parameter for Tweedie regression (#3295)

@section autotoc_md462 v0.72.1 (2018.07.08)
This version is only applicable for the Python package. The content is identical to that of v0.72.

@section autotoc_md463 v0.72 (2018.06.01)
* Starting with this release, we plan to make a new release every two months. See #3252 for more details.
* Fix a pathological behavior (near-zero second-order gradients) in multiclass objective (#3304)
* Tree dumps now use high precision in storing floating-point values (#3298)
* Submodules &lt;tt&gt;rabit&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;dmlc-core&lt;/tt&gt; have been brought up to date, bringing bug fixes (#3330, #3221).
* GPU support
  - Continuous integration tests for GPU code (#3294, #3309)
  - GPU accelerated coordinate descent algorithm (#3178)
  - Abstract 1D vector class now works with multiple GPUs (#3287)
  - Generate PTX code for most recent architecture (#3316)
  - Fix a memory bug on NVIDIA K80 cards (#3293)
  - Address performance instability for single-GPU, multi-core machines (#3324)
* Python package

* Updated Sklearn API
  - Validation sets now support instance weights (#2354)
  - &lt;tt&gt;XGBClassifier.predict_proba()&lt;/tt&gt; should not support &lt;tt&gt;output_margin&lt;/tt&gt; option. (#3343) See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* R package:
  - Better handling of NULL in &lt;tt&gt;print.xgb.Booster()&lt;/tt&gt; (#3338)
  - Comply with CRAN policy by removing compiler warning suppression (#3329)
  - Updated CRAN submission
* JVM packages
  - JVM packages will now use the same versioning scheme as other packages (#3253)
  - Update Spark to 2.3 (#3254)
  - Add scripts to cross-build and deploy artifacts (#3276, #3307)
  - Fix a compilation error for Scala 2.10 (#3332)
* BREAKING CHANGES
  - &lt;tt&gt;XGBClassifier.predict_proba()&lt;/tt&gt; no longer accepts parameter &lt;tt&gt;output_margin&lt;/tt&gt;. The parameter makes no sense for &lt;tt&gt;predict_proba()&lt;/tt&gt; because the method is to predict class probabilities, not raw margin scores.

@section autotoc_md464 v0.71 (2018.04.11)
* This is a minor release, mainly motivated by issues concerning &lt;tt&gt;pip install&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. #2426, #3189, #3118, and #3194.
  With this release, users of Linux and MacOS will be able to run &lt;tt&gt;pip install&lt;/tt&gt; for the most part.
* Refactored linear booster class (&lt;tt&gt;gblinear&lt;/tt&gt;), so as to support multiple coordinate descent updaters (#3103, #3134). See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* Fix slow training for multiclass classification with high number of classes (#3109)
* Fix a corner case in approximate quantile sketch (#3167). Applicable for 'hist' and 'gpu_hist' algorithms
* Fix memory leak in DMatrix (#3182)

  - Better linear booster class (#3103, #3134)
  - Pairwise SHAP interaction effects (#3043)
  - Cox loss (#3043)
  - AUC-PR metric for ranking task (#3172)
  - Monotonic constraints for 'hist' algorithm (#3085)
* GPU support
    - Create an abstract 1D vector class that moves data seamlessly between the main and GPU memory (#2935, #3116, #3068). This eliminates unnecessary PCIe data transfer during training time.
  - Fix minor bugs (#3051, #3217)
  - Fix compatibility error for CUDA 9.1 (#3218)
* Python package:
  - Correctly handle parameter &lt;tt&gt;verbose_eval=0&lt;/tt&gt; (#3115)

  - Compatibility fixes for latest Spark versions (#3062, #3093)
* BREAKING CHANGES: Updated linear modelling algorithms. In particular L1/L2 regularisation penalties are now normalised to number of training examples. This makes the implementation consistent with sklearn/glmnet. L2 regularisation has also been removed from the intercept. To produce linear models with the old regularisation behaviour, the alpha/lambda regularisation parameters can be manually scaled by dividing them by the number of training examples.
